== Pages Documentation

- Homepage / welcome page, if applicable
- File browsing page, represents various ways to sort, navigate through paginated products, in list view or thumbnail view
- Uploading page, represents ability to upload one or more files and enter meta data, and provides system feedback on upload process
- SFTP submission page, shares SFTP submission process and ability to enter meta data for files
- user interface for flagging files, whether this will happen directly on file browsing page, or on a separate page
- user interface for tagging files, whether this will happen directly on file browsing page, or on a separate page
- page for viewing a single file (or downloading, depending on MIME type)
- page for editing single file
- page for editing file details in batch
- page for managing user defined groups (single and list pages), including the ability to add or subtract members, edit meta data, remove groups, and look up access of group

== Notes on Stack, Dependencies

- nginx + passenger
- authentication: devise
- authorization: acl9
- ajax-upload tool: plupload
- search: solr, sunspot
- tagging: acts_as_taggable_on 
- javascript lib: jQuery, jQuery UI
- pagination: will_paginate

== Performance Considerations

- upload page: no caching
- batch management: no caching
- group management: no caching
- view / edit single file: page caching, with AJAX request followup for determining editability, sweepers to clear after edits
- facet view: fragment or Rails low level caching, methods TBD
- search view: cached, but with complex consideration of access levels
  - one cached section which contains public files
  - one section cached differently which contains partially open files 
  - how to iterate through search view to view accessible files
  - perhaps performance on Solr search will be better than h2o in the first place since objects aren't as large
