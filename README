== Data Setup

rake db:drop; rake db:create; rake db:migrate; rake db:seed; rake sunspot:reindex

== ERD Generator

railroad -M | neato -Tpng > app/assets/images/models.png

== Notes on Stack, Dependencies

- nginx + passenger
- authentication: devise
- authorization: acl9
- ajax-upload tool: plupload
- search: solr, sunspot
- tagging: acts_as_taggable_on 
- javascript lib: jQuery, jQuery UI
- pagination: will_paginate
- file metadata: fits
- background jobs: resque + redis

== Performance Considerations

- upload page: no caching
- batch management: no caching
- group management: no caching
- view / edit single file: page caching, with AJAX request followup for determining editability, sweepers to clear after edits
- facet view: fragment or Rails low level caching, methods TBD
- search view: cached, but with complex consideration of access levels
  - one cached section which contains public files
  - one section cached differently which contains partially open files 
  - how to iterate through search view to view accessible files
  - perhaps performance on Solr search will be better than h2o in the first place since objects aren't as large

== TESTING

 - config/database.yml must have test database defined
 - unit testing with RSpec (rake spec)
 - code coverage reports with RCov (rake rcov:rspec, then see http://<your_camp>/coverage/index.html)
