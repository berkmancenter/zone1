Nov. 24, 2005 - Version 5.81

  - Changed writing of TIFF so that existing IPTC will be rewritten as int32u
    whenever IPTC is edited, regardless of original format type.  This allows
    files to be 'fixed' even if IPTC was previously another format (now we get
    to see if there is any software out there that barfs on int32u's...)

Nov. 22, 2005 - Version 5.80

    X/YResolution.  Neither has a corresponding ResolutionUnit tag, so inches
    should be assumed if no resolution unit is present

  - Improved reliability of calculating offsets in Pentax maker notes

May 26, 2005 - Version 5.22

  - Fixed problem with new '-tagsFromFile @' feature which occurred when
    simultaneously copying tags and writing new values to multiple target files
    (the new values were only getting written to the first file)

May 25, 2005 - Version 5.21

    -GROUP:All and --TAG options are used together on the command line

    the value data of an IFD entry (only affects Casio images)

        function calls

Apr. 16, 2005 - Version 5.02

    notes to avoid writing a large preview to the destination file (now you have
    to do this manually afterwards if this is what you want)
  - Fixed problem rewriting Olympus E1 maker note subdirectories
  - Only validate extracted images when Binary (-b) option is used
  - Rename Olympus PreviewImageAvailable to PreviewImageValid, and check/set

  - Account for different encoding of Canon ExposureTime in 20D and 350D, and
    lower priority of Canon ExposureTime and FNumber so regular EXIF values take
    precedence because it appears these values may be model dependent (I hate it
    when that happens)

  - Extract ThumbnailImage from Canon CRW files written by some cameras
  - Recognize ORF files from Olympus C5060WZ (and hopefully some others too!)

    they aren't copied over with the -AllTagsFromFile option
  - Recognize a number of new and very uncommon EXIF tags
  - Remove copy number from tag name when using the -S option

  - Recognize JPEG 2000 XMP UUID information
  - Extract Meta information from JPEG APP3
  - Yet more playing with XP characters (this has been a learning process for
    me). Now special characters show up properly in my OSX terminal window, and
    the reverse translation works so now they get written properly as well (for
    Perl 5.6.1 or greater anyway... Earlier versions don't have the required
    UTF-8 support to handle these special characters)
  - Improvements to TagNames documentation (including changing format names to
    make them more consistent across different types of meta information)

    codestream, and doesn't contain any metadata that ExifTool can extract)

Feb. 14, 2005 - Version 4.61

  - Don't print filename line when -p option used
  - JPEG 2000 improvements

  - Change validation of CanonPictureInfo to get it working for Canon 20D

Jan. 26, 2005 - Version 4.40

  - Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't
    allowed to add or delete any new tags (just as with the MakerNotes), except
    for JpgFromRaw, which I like to be able to delete to save disk space
  - Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
  - Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed
  - Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
  - Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)
  - API Changes:

Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.33

  - Added check at higher level and return warning if trying to delete
    information from maker notes

    accept when writing
  - Updates to documentation

Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.32

  - Now rewrites Casio EX-Z3 maker notes properly (well, not actually
    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
  - Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
  - Fixed parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
  - No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character

    not copied)

    (but haven't figured out how to handle them when writing)
  - Fixed bug introduced in 4.20 that broke extraction of Canon PreviewImage

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.23

  - Improve handling of unrecognized maker notes when writing

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.22

  - Added check in -AllTagsFromFile to test for pointers in the maker notes
    directory running outside the maker notes data. If they do, a warning is
    issued and the maker notes are rebuilt properly before copying.
  - Fixed problem which could corrupt some values when editing maker notes

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.21

  - Added Olympus Red/BlueBalance

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.20

  - Added more validation when writing IPTC information
  - Fixed display of Nikon FlashExposureComp for negative values

    This allows all 3 JPEG images contained in Pentax PEF files to be extracted:
    ThumbnailImage, PreviewImage and JpgFromRaw.
  - Fixed problem on systems that use backslashes in directory names that
    prevented exiftool from finding its libraries if not installed
  - Changed many Pentax tag names to remove "Pentax" prefix and conform more to
    the other tag names (moving information between files of different formats
    is much easier if tags have standardized names):
      - PentaxPictureMode => PictureMode
      - PentaxFocusMode => FocusMode
      - PentaxWhiteBalance => WhiteBalance
      - PentaxAEMetering => MeteringMode
      - PentaxFocalLength => FocalLength

    Canonism
  - Improved logic to recognize more types of unknown maker notes
  - Recognize a couple more values of the Canon WhiteBalance tag
  - Renamed IPTC 'SupplementalCategory' to 'SupplementalCategories'
  - Handle timezone in times
  - API Changes:
