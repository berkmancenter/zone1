RELEASE NOTES
-------------

Version 0.6.0 (10/25/11)
----------------------
- Performance enhancement to make all tools run in parallel in individual threads
- Added the ADL tool for the identification of Audio Decision List files
- Added options to process directories of files.  When -i is set to a directory -o must also be set to a directory.
  The new -r option will process directories recursively when -i is a directory. 
- added <filepath> element to FileInfo tool, updated fits_output.xsd
- Fixed bug in normalizing Exiftool format output for TIFFs. "TIFF EXIF" is not output as "Tagged Image File Format"
- Fix to use <fileinfo>/<created> value for <mix:GeneralCaptureInformation>/<mix:dateTimeCreated>  when using -x switch


Version 0.5.0 (2/24/11)
----------------------
- Improved support for audio formats
- Ability to convert audio metadata to the AES audioObject schema using the -x option
- Now ising NLNZ VERSION element instead of VERSION-NAME for MP3 files 
- Fixed incorrect JP2 version reported by Exiftool
- Better identification of JP2 and JPX images (OIS bug 2876)
- Updated File Utility XSLT to improve format output (OIS bug 2897)
- Fixed DROID format output for SVG files (OIS bug 2968)
- Added ability to extract DTD references to the XmlMetadata tool from XML DOCTYPE declaration (OIS bug 2967)
- Changed file utility call to use --mime instead of -i.  File 5.03 on OS X uses -I rather than -i to print 
  the mime type and mime encoding.  --mime works on Linux and OS X.  
- Tweaked Jhove XSLT conversion of image height and width elements for files containing multiple images.  
  When multiple height or width values are found only the first one is used.
- Improved identification of EXIF and JFIF JPEGs. 

Version 0.4.3 (10/29/10)
----------------------
- Added -e cdf parameter to Unix File Utility call
- Removed Saxon transformer factory system property in ToolBase.java
- Fixed namespace of <toolOutput> elements
- Fixed namespace issues with FileInfo and XmlMetadata tools

Version 0.4.2 (7/6/10)
----------------------
- Fixed an issue with the <identification> element status attribute. If multiple tools agree
  with the identified format and there are no other identity conflicts then the attribute 
  is omitted.  The SINGLE_RESULT status attribute is used only if a single tool successfully
  identifies the file. Thanks to Swithun Crowe for the patch.
- Added -e cdf parameter to the Windows File Utility call to prevent crashes when processing 
  files that produce a large amount of output.

Version 0.4.1 (06/30/10)
----------------------
- Improved handling of File Utility output for text files
- Added 'Postscript' as a more specific format of 'Plain text' to fits_format_tree.xml
- Added 'JPEG File Interchange Format' as a more specific format of 'Raw JPEG Stream' to fits_format_tree.xml

- Fixed Exiftool primary chromaticities output
- Fixed Exiftool and Jhove orientation output.
- Updated File Utility to support version 5.03
- Changed format tree <branch format="text"> to <branch format="Plain text">

- Updated Jhove to version 1.5
- Using byteoffset=true option for Jhove TIFF module
- Fixed issue #3: using relative path instead of $FITS_HOME/path in xml/nlnz/config.xml & in XSLT when for xml/fits_output.xsd	
- Fixed issue #5: FITS 0.2.6 output file showing FITS version as 0.2.5
- Fixed usage of Exiftool scanner/digital camera make and model output
- Adjusted image metadata values to be compatible with MIX

Version 0.2.6 (8/6/09)
--------------------
- Fixed bug that prevented external identifiers from being output in <identity> sections

Version 0.2.5 (7/28/09)
---------------------
- Fixed GZIP identification output
- Fixed display-tool-output option so that all tool output is displayed
  instead of just the tools that reported a successful identification
- Exiftool mime of "application/unknown" is handled as an unknown identification (ICC files)
- All tools default unknown identification output is now normalized to 'Uknown Binary' and 
  'application/octet-stream'.
- Added a partial identification status when a tool finds only a mimetype or a format name.
  If no valid identities (mimetype and format) are returned by any tools, then tool output is 
  scanned according to the order defined in fits.xml for a partial identity (only a valid mimetype or format).
  If a partial identity is not found then the unknown identity returned by the first tool defined
  in fits.xml is used.
