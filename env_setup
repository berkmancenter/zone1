OSX has old gcc version and can't build v8 gem

brew install v8
bundle config build.libv8 --with-system-v8
bundle config build.libv8

I updated their rmagick gem so it may work out of the box for you, if not I also did this

was having depend issues with rubyracer so I got rid of it and opted for just letting node handle my js

they have postgres gem for the project so I'm guessing their example db.yml is wrong about production being mysql

copy example config/resque.ymcopy exmample config/resque.yml
copy example config/resque.ymcopy exmample config/sunspot.yml

install redis
install solr

startup redis daemon
solr is started up via rake task (be) rake sunspot:solr:start
should be good to be rails s
